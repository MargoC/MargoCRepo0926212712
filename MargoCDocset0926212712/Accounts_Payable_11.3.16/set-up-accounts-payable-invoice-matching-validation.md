title: Set up Accounts Payable invoice matching validation | Microsoft Docs
description: This recording uses the USMF demo company. The accounts payable manager or accounting manager role would perform these steps. Before you begin, make sure that the Invoice matching configuration key is selected. If your legal entity tracks expenses, such as freight, by using charges, make sure that the Charges configuration key is selected. Accounts payable invoice matching is the process of matching vendor invoice, purchase order, and product receipt information. Differences among these documents are called matching discrepancies. Matching discrepancies are compared with the tolerances that are specified. If a matching discrepancy exceeds the tolerance percentage or amount, match variance icons are displayed in the Vendor invoice page and in the Invoice matching details page.

| 4.  | Select whether approval is required before an invoice that contains discrepancies for invoice matching can be posted. If this is set to Allow with warning, visual indication will display when a discrepancy for invoice matching exceeds the tolerance. However, you will be able to post the invoice. To use workflows together with invoice matching validation, make sure that the Post invoice with discrepancies field is set to Allow with warning to avoid having to approve multiple times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 5.  | In the Automatically update invoice header match status field, select whether matching will be performed automatically during invoice data entry by the system. The recommended setting is Yes, unless you are experiencing data entry performance concerns. Disabling automatic updates may enable faster system performance because the invoice matching validation will be bypassed during data entry. The data entry clerk will need to manually update the invoice’s match status to see the invoice matching validation results when this is set to No.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 7.  | Check or uncheck the Match invoice totals checkbox to match actual invoice totals with expected totals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 8.  | Select whether an icon is displayed if a discrepancy for invoice matching exceeds the tolerance.

| 11. | In the Line matching policy field, select a value to be used as the default policy for the legal entity that you are working with. “Not required” means there is no verification of individual invoice line prices to purchase order price or invoice quantities to packing slip quantities required. “Two-Way Match” means that the verification of invoice lines is required but only the purchase order and the supplier’s invoice documents are involved in the verification. The product receipt isn’t factored into the matching validations. “Three-Way Match” means that the invoice net unit price will be compared to the purchase order’s net unit price and the matching product receipt quantity will be compared to the invoice quantity. |
