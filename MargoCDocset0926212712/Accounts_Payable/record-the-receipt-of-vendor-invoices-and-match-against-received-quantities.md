title: Record the receipt of vendor invoices and match against received quantities | Microsoft Docs
description: When you receive an invoice from a vendor for goods or services on a purchase order, the business processes might require that the goods or services be received before the invoice can be approved for payment. Before you begin, make sure that the Invoice matching configuration key is selected. In the Accounts payable parameters page, ensure that the Enable invoice matching validation option is selected, the Post invoice with discrepancies field is set to Require approval, and the Line matching policy field is set to Three-way matching. This procedure uses the USMF demo company. The accounts payable manager or accounting manager role would perform these steps.
